She had a particularly traumatic experience while playing Sue in 2005’s Fantastic Four. Specifically, she struggled with Sue’s death scene, as the film’s director kept telling her to alter her performance in unreasonable ways.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-5_42>“The director was like, ‘It looks too real. It looks too painful. Can you be prettier when you cry? … Don’t do that thing with your face. Just make it flat. We can CGI the tears in,’” she told <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Today</a> in 2010.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-6_20>According to Alba, she questioned her acting instincts so much that she was almost ready to quit acting for good.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=h-robert-pattinson-despised-playing-edward-in-twilight-and-thought-the-fans-were-weird>Robert Pattinson despised playing Edward in ‘Twilight’ and thought the fans were weird</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-2><p></p></figure><p id=par-7_55>Robert Pattinson made millions of dollars and became a global superstar thanks to the success of the Twilight series, but he hated playing Edward in the process. When asked if he’d be a fan of the movies if he wasn’t involved, he famously told <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Moviefone</a> that he’d probably “mindlessly hate it without having seen anything.”&nbsp;</p><p id=par-8_38>He also told Vanity Fair that he found the hype, fans, and series strange, and said that Twilight photo shoots were awkward for him because he’s “kind of representing something you don’t particularly like,” according to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">W Magazine</a>.</p><h2 id=h-6-you-star-penn-badgley-wants-joe-to-die>6. ‘You’ star Penn Badgley wants Joe to die&nbsp;</h2><p id=par-9_56>Penn Badgley’s portrayal of Joe on the popular Netflix series You has amused and repulsed viewers for the last few years, but no one has been more disgusted by the character than Badgley himself. He’s said on numerous occasions that playing the role is an extremely conflicting process and doesn’t like playing the character at all.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-10_21>According to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Popdust</a>, he once admitted that his character is “irredeemable,” and said that he hopes Joe’s story ends with “death.”&nbsp;</p><h2 id=h-7-jeremy-renner-hated-his-portrayal-of-hawkeye-in-the-avengers>7.

He told <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">BBC</a> that his experience transitioning from Mandela: Long Walk to Freedom to Thor was “torture” and found his costume for the movie ridiculous.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-15_75>“In between takes I was stuck there, fake hair stuck onto my head with glue … while they reset. And I’m thinking, Twenty-four hours ago, I was Mandela. When I walked into the set, the extras called me Madiba (Mandela’s clan name). I was literally walking in this man’s boots. Then there I was, in this stupid harness, with this wig and this sword and these contact lenses. It ripped my heart out,” Elba said.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS1sLjLsq6op5RiwLWt0axkoZmkmrFuwMeeoKtlnaTAtXnFmqSoraNiv7C4xKxloaydoXw%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fhollywood-stars-hated-their-most-famous-roles-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fhollywood-stars-hated-their-most-famous-roles-html.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fhollywood-stars-hated-their-most-famous-roles-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fhollywood-stars-hated-their-most-famous-roles-html.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fhollywood-stars-hated-their-most-famous-roles-html.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fhollywood-stars-hated-their-most-famous-roles-html.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./danny-duncan.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./danny-duncan.html>Danny Duncan Mustang, Wikipedia, Still Alive, Death, Injury, Dead</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./certifikid-net-worth-and-shark-tank-update-2022.html>Certifikid Net Worth And Shark Tank Update</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./certifikid-net-worth-and-shark-tank-update-2022.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
