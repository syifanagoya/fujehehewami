The choose-your-own-adventure murder mystery promises to offer the player a unique experience based on which trait they choose to give the main character, Grace. The options are “charming,” “kickass,” or “clever,” and putting Grace in one of these mindsets affects the storyline and narrative, as well as the music.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=399 data-current-count=399 data-injectable=false>The idea for Stray Gods was said to be inspired by the Buffy the Vampire Slayer musical episode “Once More, with Feeling,” and that inspiration rings true when you play Stray Gods. Composer Austin Wintory <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">claims</a> that there is a plethora of “easter egg” content in this game, so much so that he’s certain there’s only about a 5% chance of a player ever finding it.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=699 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=179 data-current-count=179 data-injectable=false>They got the absolute cream of the crop for this crowd-funded 2D Humble Games venture.

Bestowed with the power of song she never asked for by the “last muse” — Calliope — Grace is tasked with proving she did not murder her — even though she literally has Calliope’s blood on her hands — and she has only one week to do so. Grace will be played by veteran voice actor Laura Bailey. Bailey’s credits include Serana in&nbsp;The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim – Dawnguard, &nbsp;Abby Anderson&nbsp;in the video game&nbsp;The Last of Us Part II, and Tohru Honda&nbsp;in&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Fruits Basket</a>, among others.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Persephone&nbsp;–&nbsp;Mary Elizabeth McGlynn</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=294 data-current-count=594 data-injectable=true>The brooding god of the underworld is portrayed by Mary Elizabeth McGlynn.

He is voiced by Khary Payton – known for his roles as&nbsp;King Ezekiel&nbsp;on The Walking Dead&nbsp;and Dr. Terrell Jackson on the soap opera&nbsp;General Hospital, Payton has also done voice work for the animated series&nbsp;Young Justice.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Eros&nbsp;–&nbsp;Abubakar Salim</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=380 data-current-count=680 data-injectable=true>Not much is known about the character of Eros at this time — he doesn’t show up in the demo — but surely, he will be there to manipulate the characters into falling in love. Eros is played by Kenyan actor Abubakar Salim. Known for his roles in the series&nbsp;Jamestown and&nbsp;Raised by Wolves, Salim’s voice work includes the video game&nbsp;Assassin’s Creed Origins.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Athena&nbsp;–&nbsp;Felicia Day</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=542 data-current-count=842 data-injectable=true>Athena — the “goddess of wisdom” — seems to be the top dog of the chorus, and the most wise, as she sits at the desk and they all sort of stand around her. Athena is voiced by actress, writer, and content creator Felicia Day. Day was cast as&nbsp;Vi&nbsp;in the series&nbsp;Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Dr. Holly Marten in&nbsp;Eureka, and&nbsp;Charlie Bradbury&nbsp;on&nbsp;Supernatural.

A favorite of filmmaker Mike Flanagan, you may recognize Kohli from such roles as Dr. Ravi Chakrabarti in&nbsp;iZombie, Owen Sharma in&nbsp;The Haunting of Bly Manor, and Sheriff Hassan in&nbsp;Midnight Mass. His voice work includes the animated series, Harley Quinn.</p><p data-characters=143 data-current-count=143 data-injectable=false>Just in case you weren’t already enough of a fan of Kohli, he has long been an ally of transgender people and uses gender-fluid pronouns.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Hecate&nbsp;–&nbsp;Allegra Clark</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=443 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=361 data-current-count=361 data-injectable=false>Hecate also did not appear in the demo, but presumably, she will appear when Grace is at a crossroads.

I used to have a scorpion named Calliope. Calliope will be voiced by veteran actress and California native Ashley Johnson. With a resume longer than both of your arms, I will try to just list a few here: Johnson played Anna in the TV adaptation of The Last of Us, Ellie in the video game version, Chrissy Seaver on&nbsp;the TV series Growing Pains, and her unique voice has landed her voice work on video games such as Teen Titans, Ben 10: Alien Force, and Cartoon Network: Punch Time Explosion – to name a very few.
