<time>21 Feb 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p>On his fifth wedding anniversary post to his wife who “makes his soul smile,” American rapper Jelly-Roll wrote,</p><p>“Before I met you I would’ve never thought I’d ever be a happily married guy.</p><p>“Many people claimed that we had little chance of success and that this was just a phase or “fling.”<br>For the next 50 years, let’s disprove the detractors and validate the supporters.<br>You are everything to me.”</p><p>In his anniversary post, Jelly issued a warning to the naysayers, stating that he was adamant about making his love tale “one of the best ones ever recounted.”</p><p>Jelly-Roll met his wife while his career was at its lowest point; today, he has it all, including a successful career and a happy marriage.<br>He featured in an interview with King and the Sting Clips in 2020, telling the fascinating tale of how he met his wife.</p><h2>Jelly Roll Discourses On His Wife</h2><p>The rapper’s joy during the interview when discussing his wife, Bunnie Xo, real name Bunnie DeFord, reveals just how content he is with her. A little history of his wife reveals that she has worked in the entertainment sector for several years and helped to establish Dumb Blond Productions.</p><p>She has a flourishing profession and is also a model, podcast host, and well-known internet personality with a large online fan base.</p><p>Jelly-Roll, also known as Jason DeFord, began his love story by revealing that he had met his wife during a concert.<br>At the time, Jelly’s job was hardly moving forward, forcing him to live in a van. In contrast, his wife’s profession was flourishing, and he attributed her success to possessing “a penthouse condo and two sports vehicles.”</p><p>It didn’t take long for their initial meeting to develop into something spectacular. The couple began dating and eventually got married “randomly at a DefTone concert.”</p><p>The pair went to a courthouse late at night to legalize their bond since they were determined to get married. Jelly continued to elaborate on his love tale by saying,</p><p>“We were the unheard-of story when we first began.<br>She is also practically my best friend.<br>She has encouraged me and helped me launch a successful music career.”</p><p>His wife was his most important source of support while he was in the worst financial situation, helping her in any way she could, in addition to financially.</p><p>Their relationship began as a whirlwind of chance encounters, and today, after five years of marriage, they cherish each other and look forward to many more.</p><p>Jelly and his wife frequently use their social media accounts to express their love and gratitude to one another because they are rather open about their romantic relationships.</p><p>His wife sent her best wishes for the rapper Jelly on one of the most recent Instagram photos made in honor of his birthday, writing,</p><p>“My twin flame, my soulmate, and my best friend for the rest of my life.<br>Stupid happy birthday!<br>There isn’t a person I would rather spend my golden years with.<br>Even though we were the chaotic ones and wild ones when we first met, we’ve managed to build such a calm life together.”</p><p>Nothing seemed to be able to break their undeniable chemistry any time soon. Along with his adored wife, the rapper uses his social media accounts to show his affection for his family.</p><h2>Family Guy’s Jolly Roll</h2><p>Jelly-Roll is already a dad to his two children, a daughter, and a son, from his prior relationship, even if he and his wife have not yet had their biological child.</p><p>He periodically posts pictures of his kids on social media, but he has never referred to their mother. The rapper wrote, “Family is everything to me,” in a message on Instagram devoted to his young son.</p><p>“Being firmly established in family is something I take great satisfaction in.</p><p>I don’t talk or publish much about my son out of respect for his mother’s privacy.”</p><p>Even if the rapper conceals the mother of his children, his social media posts frequently demonstrate how close Bunnie is to his children. According to a post on Instagram by Jelly’s singing daughter Bailee Ann, Bunnie is very close to Jelly’s children. Bailee showed her enthusiasm for writing in the Instagram post she made in honor of her stepmother Bunnie.</p><p>“She has spent a long time with me here.<br>With the snap of her fingers, she can change a scowl into a smile.<br>Our lives have improved because of her, and they will never be the same.<br>Without her, we wouldn’t be in the position we are today.”</p><p>Overall, with the assistance of his devoted wife and encouraging family members, Jelly’s tumultuous existence has finally come to a peaceful conclusion. Jelly’s successful profession has earned him a sizeable net worth, potentially in the millions, which adds to his wealthy life.</p><p>Also Read, <a href=#>Giacomo Raspadori</a>, <a href=#>Ivan Rakitic</a>, and <a href=#>Ysabelle Wallace</a>.</p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>Rapper</a></span> <a href=#></a><h3 class=small-font><a href=#>Gabe Tamariz</a></h3>Gabe Tamariz estimated Net Worth, Biography, Age, Height, Dating, Relationship Records, Salary, Income, Cars, Lifestyles & many more details have been updated below.
